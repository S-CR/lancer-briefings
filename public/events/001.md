The squad finally met each other en-route to the recently-rediscovered planetoid known as **HERCYNIA**. Guided by MSMC Commanding Officer **SNAKEMAN**, Squad **DELTA-ECHO-ECHO-ZULU** was given a rudimentary team-building exercise known as Virtual Training. 

**COMPADRE** reached for his antique relic of a firearm and started twirling it flawlessly. While this was happening, **KAL** attempted to tap into the virtual training's mainframe in order to give her team an advantage - this backfired spectacularly, as **SNAKEMAN** was watching her with his one good eye instead of watching the showmanship **COMPADRE** was putting on.

After witnessing **KAL** incorrectly guess his administrator password a couple of times, **SNAKEMAN** blankly states that if **KAL** wanted a challenge, all they had to do was ask. Because of this, the squad was pushed to the brink in what was supposed to be a confidence booster.

After the exercise, **SNAKEMAN** rests his cane against his body and starts applauding their efforts. He mentions that there will be more training coming up, so get used to it and enjoy the commodities on the ship while they still can - there's no knowing how civilized this new planet is.
