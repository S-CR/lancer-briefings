# Mission // #002
## Daybreak
# Objectives
Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Parameters
Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/
commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city. The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Stakes
If the enemy jamming network isn't neutralized on schedule, it will set back the timetable for the LSA's counteroffensive into Nov Elysia's central district. Should the Union fail to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee, it may result in them being taken prisoner or killed.

# Reward
TBD.

# Reserves
TBD.
