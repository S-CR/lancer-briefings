# Mission // #001
## The Drop
# Objectives
Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.

# Parameters
Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and
Ambassador Bannerjee. 

# Reward
Once the players arrive at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be evaluated and field upgrades will be distributed accordingly.

# Reserves
None at this time.
