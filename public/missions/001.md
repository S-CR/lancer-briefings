# Mission // #001
## The Drop
# Objectives
~~Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.~~

Make your way through Nov Elysia to reach FOB Saber.

# Parameters
Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee. 

Failure to clear an approach corridor to FOB Saber through Sovereignty defenses will result in additional casualties and delays for second-wave reinforcements arriving from the Rio Grande.

# Reward
Once the players arrive at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be evaluated and field upgrades will be distributed accordingly.

# Reserves
None at this time.
